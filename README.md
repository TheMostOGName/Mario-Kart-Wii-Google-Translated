# Mario-Kart-Wii-Google-Translated
I will be translating all of Mario Kart Wii

# About:

This is going to be an interesting project. I am going to Google Translate every single word in Mario Kart Wii.
But at the moment, it's nowhere near done. I still have to:

-  Finish translating miscellaneous .bmgs (The raw text files)
-  Finish making the trailer so other people can know about it
-  Finish retexturing all the billboards and all that stuff in the tracks themselves
-  Pack it up so people can use it with Riivolution.

This may sound like a lot, but I'd say I'm already a third of the way done. The two files I have already translated, common.bmg and menu.bmg, are MASSIVE.
You can view them in the repository. 

# Installation (when it's done)

This will be allllll about installing the distribution when it's finished. Here's how it's going to work. Currently, this project is still heavily in development. 
When it's finished, there will be two .zips in the main repository. One of them will be the open source raw files, the .bmg's, the .szs', all that good stuff. If you want to
change my edits, you can use this folder to do it easily. I'm pretty sure I have a license that states that you can edit and publish it to your hearts content, as long as you keep it open source. This folder will be organised with a .txt explaining what everything does, how to edit it, the whole nine yards. 

The other .zip will be the Riivolution folder. You can use this if you only want to play the hack. I'm going to put some detailed instructions on how to install this mod, assuming, of course, you've homebrewed your Wii. If you haven't, you can find a good tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByabEgYHJ1c). Okay, now for the instructions
on how to install the mod that doesn't exist yet! 

### 1. 
Copy the "Riivolution" folder into the root of your SD card. If a Riivolution folder already exists on the root of your SD card, expand it. Copy the *contents* of the Google 
Translate mod's Riivolution folder into the Riivolution folder on your SD card. 

### 2.
Copy the MKWGT folder onto the root of your SD card. 

### 3. 
Copy the "apps" folder onto the root of your SD card. If an "apps" folder already exists on the root of your SD card, expand it. Copy the *contents* of the Google 
Translate mod's apps folder into the apps folder on your SD card. 

### 4.
You're done! Insert the SD card back into the Wii, and boot up the homebrew channel, or the Riivolution channel if you have it preinstalled. (If you don't, just run it through
the homebrew channel). Set the Google Translated option to "on", and enjoy!


I'm sorry if you're experienced with installing riivo mods and had to look at that, I'm trying to be more open and consise with modding MKWii. When I started, instructions
on installing riivo hacks and stuff on the homebrew channel was overcomplicated and made the already strong introduction barrier to Wii hacking even stronger. The text file
in the open source folder will probably be worse. I'm going to try to explain everything as thoroughly and with as little of an introduction barrier as I can. Anyway, this
hack doesn't even exist yet lmfao. I'm going to go upload some of the stuff I've already done then get back to work!
