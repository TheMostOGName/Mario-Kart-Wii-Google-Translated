# So this file will just be about my progress.


## 3/26/2021

First entry! As you can see in the README, most of the raw text files are finished. Well today I can confirm: ALL of the raw text files are finished! Huzza! Other big news:
I'm working on the tracks now. I've finished about 24 out of 101, so that's pretty cool I guess.
### ETA: 
Okay I know in my youtube video about it I said "late March", but uhh... I'm a Nintendo modder. When have we ever stuck to a schedule. All I have to do is finish the other
77 tracks, test everything, make it bootable in Riivolution, and then it's ready! I guess I'll also have to update the github text files and everything, but whatever lmao. 
It took me about an hour and a half to finish those 24 tracks, so I estimate it'll take another 4 to 4.5 more hours to finish the rest of them. The goal is to have that done
by Thursday next week (4/2/21). Then, Friday I'll pack everything up and it'll be ready for release on Saturday (2/6/21)!

Some stuff came up that completely threw out the previous ETA. I'm taking a break from this mod to make other stuff. I'll probably start working on it again in May
